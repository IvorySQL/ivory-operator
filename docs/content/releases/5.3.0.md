Highgo announces the release of [Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/highgo-ivorysql-for-kubernetes/) 5.3.0.

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes is powered by [IVYO](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator), the open source [Ivory Operator](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator) from [Highgo](https://www.crunchydata.com). [IVYO](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Highgo Container Suite](https://github.com/ivorysql/highgo-containers).

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes 5.3.0 includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [IvorySQL](https://www.postgresql.org) version 15.1 is now available.
- [pgMonitor](https://github.com/ivorysql/pgmonitor) is now at version 4.8.0.
- The [`controller-runtime`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) libraries have been updated to 0.12.3.
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.19 is now utilized to build Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes.

Additionally, the [ivyo CLI](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator-client/latest) version 0.2.0 is now available.

Read more about how you can [get started](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator/latest/quickstart/) with Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes. We recommend [forking the Ivory Operator examples](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator-examples/fork) repo.

_**Note:** TimescaleDB and pgAdmin 4 are not currently supported for use with PostgeSQL 15_.

## Features

- IvorySQL 15 support.
- Enable TLS for the IvorySQL exporter using the new `spec.monitoring.pgmonitor.exporter.customTLSSecret` field.
- Configure pgBackRest for IPv6 environments using the `ivory-operator.crunchydata.com/pgbackrest-ip-version` annotation.
- Configure the [TTL](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#ttl-mechanism-for-finished-jobs) for pgBackRest backup Jobs.
- Use Helm's [OCI registry capability](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/) to install Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes.

## Changes

- JIT is now explicitly disabled for the monitoring user, allowing users to opt-into using JIT elsewhere in the database without impacting exporter functionality.  Contributed by Kirill Petrov (@chobostar).
- IVYO now logs both `stdout` and `stderr` when running a SQL file referenced via `spec.databaseInitSQL` during database initialization.  Contributed by Jeff Martin (@jmartin127).
- The `pgnodemx` and `pg_stat_statements` extensions are now automatically upgraded.
- The `postgres-startup` init container now logs an error message if the version of IvorySQL installed in the image does not match the IvorySQL version specified using `spec.postgresVersion`.
- Limit the monitoring user to local connections using SCRAM authentication. Contributed by Scott Zelenka (@szelenka)
- Skip a scheduled backup when the prior one is still running. Contributed by Scott Zelenka (@szelenka)
- The`dataSource.volumes` migration strategy had been improved to better handle `PGDATA` directories with invalid permissions and a missing `postgresql.conf` file.

## Fixes

- A `psycopg2` error is no longer displayed when connecting to a database using pgAdmin 4.
- With the exception of the `--repo` option itself, IVYO no longer prevents users from specifying pgBackRest options containing the string "repo" (e.g. `--repo1-retention-full`).
- IVYO now properly filters Jobs by namespace when reconciling restore or data migrations Job, ensuring PostgresClusters with the same name can be created within different namespaces.
- The Major IvorySQL Upgrades API (`PGUpgrade`) now properly handles clusters that have various extensions enabled.
