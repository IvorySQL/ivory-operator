[IVYO](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Highgo Container Suite](https://github.com/ivorysql/container-suite).

## Features

- The JDBC connection string for the Ivory database and a PgBouncer instance is now available in the User Secret using `jdbc-uri` and `pgbouncer-jdbc-uri` respectively.
- Editing the `password` field of a User Secret now [changes a password]({{< relref "architecture/user-management.md" >}}#custom-passwords), instead of having to create a verifier.

## Changes

- [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) is now automatically enabled when using the `highgo-ivory-gis` container.
- The [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) is mounted to the `database` containers.
- [pgnodemx](https://github.com/ivorysql/pgnodemx) can now be enabled and used without having to enable monitoring.
- The description of the `name` field for an instance set now states that a name is only optional when a single instance set is defined.

## Fixes

- Fix issue when performing a restore with IvorySQL 14. Specifically, if there are mismatched IvorySQL configuration parameters, IVYO will resume replay and let IvorySQL crash so IVYO can ultimately fix it, vs. the restore pausing indefinitely.
- The pgBackRest Pod no longer automatically mounts the default Service Account. Reported by (@Shrivastava-Varsha).
- The Jobs that move data between volumes now have the correct Security Context set.
- The UBI 8 `highgo-upgrade` container contains all recent IvorySQL versions that can be upgraded.
- Ensure controller references are used for all objects that need them, instead of owner references.
- It is no longer necessary to have external WAL volumes enabled in order to upgrade a IVYO v4 cluster to IVYO v5 using the "Migrate From Backups" or "Migrate Using a Standby Cluster" upgrade methods.
