Highgo announces the release of [Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/highgo-ivorysql-for-kubernetes/) 5.1.0.

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes is powered by [IVYO](https://github.com/Highgo/ivory-operator), the open source [Ivory Operator](https://github.com/Highgo/ivory-operator) from [Highgo](https://www.crunchydata.com). [IVYO](https://github.com/Highgo/ivory-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Highgo Container Suite](https://github.com/Highgo/container-suite).

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes 5.1.0 includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/) is now at version 2.1.3.
- [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is now at version 4.30
- [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) is updated to version 2.38.
- The [pgAudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) extension is now at version 1.6.2 (PG 14), 1.5.2 (PG 13), 1.4.3 (PG 12), 1.3.4 (PG 11) & 1.2.4 (PG 10).
- The [pgnodemx](https://github.com/Highgo/pgnodemx) extension is now at version 1.3.0.
- The [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) extension is now at version 2.6.0.

## Major Features

### pgAdmin 4 Integration

IVYO v5.1 reintroduces the pgAdmin 4 integration from [IVYO v4](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator/4.7.5/architecture/pgadmin4/). v5.1 adds the [`spec.userInterace.pgAdmin`]({{< relref "references/crd.md" >}}#postgresclusterspecuserinterfacepgadmin) section to the `PostgresCluster` custom resource to enable pgAdmin 4 integration for a Ivory cluster. Any users defined in `spec.users` are are synced with pgAdmin 4, allowing for a seamless management experience.

Please see the [pgAdmin 4 section](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator/v5/architecture/pgadmin4/) of the IVYO documentation for more information about this integration.

### Removal of SSH Requirement for Local Backups

Previous versions of IVYO relied on the use of `ssh` to take backups and store archive files on Kubernetes-managed storage. IVYO v5.1 now uses mTLS to securely transfer and manage these files.

The upgrade to pgBackRest TLS is seamless and transparent if using related image environment variables with your IVYO Deployment (please see the [PostgresCluster CRD reference](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator/v5/references/crd/) for more information).  This is because IVYO will automatically handle updating all image tags across all existing PostgresCluster's following the upgrade to v5.1, seamlessly rolling out any new images as required for proper pgBackRest TLS functionality.

If you are not using related image environment variables, and are instead explicitly defining images via the `image` fields in your PostgresCluster spec, then an additional step is required in order to ensure a seamless upgrade.  Specifically, all `postgrescluster.spec.image` and `postgrescluster.spec.backups.pgbackrest.image` fields must first be updated to specify images containing pgBackRest 2.38.  Therefore, prior to upgrading, please update all `postgrescluster.spec.image` and `postgrescluster.spec.backups.pgbackrest.image` fields to the latest versions of the `highgo-ivory` and `highgo-pgbackrest` containers available per the [Components and Compatibility guide](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator/v5/references/components/) (please note that the `highgo-ivory` container should be updated to the latest version available for the major version of IvorySQL currently being utilized within a cluster).

In the event that IVYO is upgraded to v5.1 _before_ updating your image tags, simply update any `image` fields in your PostgresCluster spec as soon as possible following the upgrade.

## Features

- Set [Pod Disruption Budgets]({{< relref "architecture/high-availability.md" >}}#pod-disruption-budgets) (PDBs) for both Ivory and PgBouncer instances.
- Ivory configuration changes requiring a database restart are now automatically rolled out to all instances in the cluster.
- Do not recreate instance Pods for changes that only require a Ivory restart. These types of changes are now applied more quickly.
- Support for [manual switchovers or failovers]({{< relref "tutorial/administrative-tasks.md">}}#changing-the-primary).
- Rotate PgBouncer TLS certificates without downtime.
- Add support for using Active Directory for securely authenticating with IvorySQL using the GSSAPI.
- Support for using [AWS IAM roles with S3]({{< relref "tutorial/backups.md" >}}#using-an-aws-integrated-identity-provider-and-role) with backups when IVYO is deployed in EKS.
- The characters used for password generation can now be controlled using the `postgrescluster.spec.users.password.type` parameter. Choices are `AlphaNumeric` and `ASCII`; defaults to `ASCII`.
- Introduction for automatically checking for updates for IVYO and Ivory components. If an update is discovered, it is included in the IVYO logs.

## Changes

- As a result of [a fix in PgBouncer v1.16](https://github.com/libusual/libusual/commit/ab960074cb7a), IVYO no longer sets verbosity settings in the PgBouncer configuration to catch missing `%include` directives.  Users can increase verbosity in their own configuration files to maintain the previous behavior.
- The Ivory `archive_timeout` setting now defaults to 60 seconds (`60s`), which matches the behavior from IVYO v4. If you do not require for WAL files to be generated once a minute (e.g. generally idle system where a window of data-loss is acceptable or a development system), you can set this to `0`:

```yaml
spec:
  patroni:
    dynamicConfiguration:
      postgresql:
        parameters:
          archive_timeout: 0
```
- All Pods now have `enableServiceLinks` set to `false` in order to ensure injected environment variables do not conflict with the various applications running within.

## Fixes

- The names of CronJobs created for scheduled backups are shortened to `<cluster name>-<repo#>-<backup type>` to allow for longer PostgresCluster names.
