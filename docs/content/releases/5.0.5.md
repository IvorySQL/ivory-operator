## Features

- A S3, GCS or Azure data source can now be configured when bootstrapping a new PostgresCluster.  This allows existing cloud-based pgBackRest repositories to be utilized to bootstrap new clusters, while also ensuring those new clusters create and utilize their own pgBackRest repository for archives and backups (rather than writing to the repo utilized to bootstrap the cluster).
- It is now possible to configure the number of workers for the PostgresCluster controller.

## Fixes

- Reduce scope of automatic OpenShift environment detection. This looks specifically for the existence of the `SecurityContextConstraint` API.
- An external IP is no longer copied to the primary service (e.g. `hippo-primary`) when the `LoadBalancer` service type has been configured for IvorySQL.
- pgBackRest no longer logs to log `/tmp` emptyDir by default.  Instead, pgBackRest logs to either the `PGDATA` volume (if running inside of a PG instance Pod) or a pgBackRest repository volume (if running inside a dedicated repo host Pod).
- All pgBackRest configuration resources are now copied from the source cluster when cloning a PG cluster.
- Image pull secrets are now set on directory move jobs.
- Resources are now properly set on the `nss-wrapper-init` container.
