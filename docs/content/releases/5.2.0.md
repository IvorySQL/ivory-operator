Highgo announces the release of [Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/highgo-ivorysql-for-kubernetes/) 5.2.0.

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes is powered by [IVYO](https://github.com/Highgo/ivory-operator), the open source [Ivory Operator](https://github.com/Highgo/ivory-operator) from [Highgo](https://www.crunchydata.com). [IVYO](https://github.com/Highgo/ivory-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Highgo Container Suite](https://github.com/Highgo/highgo-containers).

## Major Features

This and all IVYO v5 releases are compatible with a brand new `ivyo` command line interface.
Please see the [`ivyo` CLI documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/ivory-operator-client/latest)
for its release notes and more details.

## Features

- Added the ability to customize and influence the scheduling of pgBackRest backup Jobs using `affinity` and `tolerations`.
- You can now pause the reconciliation and rollout of changes to a IvorySQL cluster using the `spec.paused` field.
- Leaf certificates provisioned by IVYO as part of a IvorySQL cluster's TLS infrastructure are now automatically rotated prior to expiration.
- IVYO now has support for feature gates.
- You can now add custom sidecars to both IvorySQL instance Pods and PgBouncer Pods using the `spec.instances.containers` and `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.containers` fields.
- It is now possible to configure standby clusters to replicate from a remote primary using streaming replication.
- Added the ability to provide a custom `nodePort` for the primary IvorySQL, pgBouncer and pgAdmin services.
- Added the ability to define custom labels and annotations for the primary IvorySQL, pgBouncer and pgAdmin services.

## Changes

- All containers are now run with the minimum capabilities required by the container runtime.
- The IVYO documentation now includes instructions for rotating the root TLS certificate.
- A `fsGroupChangePolicy` of `OnRootMismatch` is now set on all Pods.
- The `runAsNonRoot` security setting is on every container rather than every pod.

## Fixes

- A better timeout has been set for the `pg_ctl` `start` and `stop` commands that are run during a restore.
- A restore can now be re-attempted if IVYO is unable to cleanly start or stop the database during a previous restore attempt.
