Highgo announces the release of [Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/highgo-ivorysql-for-kubernetes/) 5.0.3.

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes is powered by [IVYO](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator), the open source [Ivory Operator](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator) from [Highgo](https://www.crunchydata.com). [IVYO](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Highgo Container Suite](https://github.com/ivorysql/container-suite).

Highgo Ivory for Kubernetes 5.0.3 includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [IvorySQL](https://www.postgresql.org) 14 is now available.
- [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) is updated to version 2.35.
- [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/) is updated to version 2.1.1.
- The [pgAudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) extension is now at version 1.6.0.
- The [pgAudit Analyze](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit_analyze) extension is now at version 1.0.8.
- The [pgnodemx](https://github.com/ivorysql/pgnodemx) extension is now at version 1.0.5.
- The [set_user](https://github.com/pgaudit/set_user) extension is now at version 3.0.0.
- The [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) extension is now at version 2.4.

## Features

- The Ivory containers are renamed. `highgo-ivory-ha` is now `highgo-ivory`, and `highgo-ivory-gis-ha` is now `highgo-ivory-gis`.
- Some network filesystems are sensitive to Linux user and group permissions. Process GIDs can now be configured through `PostgresCluster.spec.supplementalGroups` for when your PVs don't advertise their [GID requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#access-control).
- A replica service is now automatically reconciled for access to Ivory replicas within a cluster.
- The Ivory primary service and PgBouncer service can now each be configured to have either a `ClusterIP`, `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service type. Suggested by Bryan A. S. (@bryanasdev000).
- [Pod Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/) can now be specified for Ivory instances, the pgBackRest dedicated repository host as well as PgBouncer. Suggested by Annette Clewett.
- Default topology spread constraints are included to ensure IVYO always attempts to deploy a high availability cluster architecture.
- IVYO can now execute a custom SQL script when initializing a Ivory cluster.
- Custom resource requests and limits are now configurable for all `init` containers, therefore ensuring the desired [Quality of Service (QoS)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/) class can be assigned to the various Pods comprising a cluster.
- Custom resource requests and limits are now configurable for all Jobs created for a `PostgresCluster`.
- A [Pod Priority Class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/) is configurable for the Pods created for a `PostgresCluster`.
- An `imagePullPolicy` can now be configured for Pods created for a `PostgresCluster`.
-  Existing `PGDATA`, Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and pgBackRest repository volumes can now be migrated from IVYO v4 to IVYO v5 by specifying a `volumes` data source when creating a `PostgresCluster`.
- There is now a [migration guide available for moving Ivory clusters between IVYO v4 to IVYO v5]({{< relref "upgrade/v4tov5/_index.md" >}}).
- The pgAudit extension is now enabled by default in all clusters.
- There is now additional validation for PVC definitions within the `PostgresCluster` spec to ensure successful PVC reconciliation.
- Ivory server certificates are now automatically reloaded when they change.

## Changes

- The supplemental group `65534` is no longer applied by default. Upgrading the operator will perform a rolling update on all `PostgresCluster` custom resources to remove it.

  If you need this GID for your network filesystem, you should perform the following steps when upgrading:

  1. Before deploying the new operator, deploy the new CRD. You can get the new CRD from the [Ivory Operator Examples](https://github.com/ivorysql/ivory-operator-examples/fork) repository and executing the following command:
     ```console
     $ kubectl apply -k kustomize/install
     ```

  2. Add the group to your existing `PostgresCluster` custom resource:
     ```console
     $ kubectl edit postgrescluster/hippo

     kind: PostgresCluster
     …
     spec:
       supplementalGroups:
       - 65534
     …
     ```

     _or_

     ```console
     $ kubectl patch postgrescluster/hippo --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"supplementalGroups":[65534]}}'
     ```

     _or_

     by modifying `spec.supplementalGroups` in your manifest.

  3. Deploy the new operator. If you are using an up-to-date version of the manifest, you can run:
     ```console
     $ kubectl apply -k kustomize/install
     ```

- A dedicated pgBackRest repository host is now only deployed if a `volume` repository is configured.  This means that deployments that use only cloud-based (`s3`, `gcs`, `azure`) repos will no longer see a dedicated repository host, nor will `SSHD` run in within that Ivory cluster. As a result of this change, the `spec.backups.pgbackrest.repoHost.dedicated` section is removed from the `PostgresCluster` spec, and all settings within it are consolidated under the `spec.backups.pgbackrest.repoHost` section. When upgrading please update the `PostgresCluster` spec to ensure any settings from section `spec.backups.pgbackrest.repoHost.dedicated` are moved into section `spec.backups.pgbackrest.repoHost`.
- PgBouncer now uses SCRAM when authenticating into Ivory.
- Generated Ivory certificates include the FQDN and other local names of the primary Ivory service. To regenerate the certificate of an existing cluster, delete the `tls.key` field from its certificate secret.  Suggested by @ackerr01.

## Fixes

- Validation for the PostgresCluster spec is updated to ensure at least one repo is always defined for section `spec.backups.pgbackrest.repos`.
- A restore will now complete successfully If `max_connections` and/or `max_worker_processes` is configured to a value higher than the default when backing up the Ivory database. Reported by Tiberiu Patrascu (@tpatrascu).
- The installation documentation now properly defines how to set the `PGO_TARGET_NAMESPACE` environment variable for a single namespace installation.
- Ensure the full allocation of shared memory is available to Ivory containers. Reported by Yuyang Zhang (@helloqiu).
- OpenShift auto-detection logic now looks for the presence of the `SecurityContextConstraints` API to avoid false positives when APIs with an `openshift.io` Group suffix are installed in non-OpenShift clusters.  Reported by Jean-Daniel.
