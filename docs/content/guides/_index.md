This section contains guides on handling various scenarios when managing Ivory clusters using IVYO, the Ivory Operator. These include step-by-step instructions for situations such as migrating data to a IVYO managed Ivory cluster or upgrading from an older version of IVYO.

These guides are in no particular order: choose the guide that is most applicable to your situation.

If you are looking for how to manage most day-to-day Ivory scenarios, we recommend first going through the [Tutorial]({{< relref "tutorial/_index.md" >}}).
